At Robin AI I was all about improving processes and making our team more efficient. I kicked things off by building a self-serve onboarding flow that boosted our user base by 80% - no more relying on only cold calls! Then, I led the charge on an AI-powered Word add-in for lawyers, whipping it up in just two months. To keep us all on the same page, I created our first feature design document, which became our go-to for new projects. I also spearheaded the summary reports feature, streamlining lawyers' workflows with some React magic and AI data extraction.

During my time here, I teamed up with our IT crew to create a responsive Blockchain Dashboard that lets customers keep tabs on our crypto assets and market trends. It was fun diving into Bootstrap 4, CSS, and JS to make it work smoothly across different browsers. I also whipped up a nifty JavaScript calculator for our agricultural customers to figure out prices with interest. On the security side, I helped streamline our access control procedures, making sure we kept track of everyone coming and going. And because I love a good data challenge, I built an Excel interface to clean up and collect data on our loan beneficiaries. It was a diverse role that kept me on my toes, blending tech skills with practical business needs.

At bp, I wore many hats as a full-stack developer. From building payment systems for European fleet managers to leading UI development for our global supplier portal, I tackled diverse challenges. I modernized legacy code and even built custom apps using integrating cloud services. My favorite part? Juggling everything from mobile app security to DevOps integration. Throughout these projects, I utilized a diverse tech stack including Node.js, Express, GraphQL, React Native, .NET, and various cloud platforms.

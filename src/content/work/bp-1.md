Had the opportunity to build out a web-based platform that axed about 60 daily emails and manual Excel work. Designing the interface was a highlight - used by three trading teams! I also got to flex my data muscles, creating Power BI dashboards for four different business functions. It was incredibly rewarding to see my work directly impact so many aspects of our company's daily grind.

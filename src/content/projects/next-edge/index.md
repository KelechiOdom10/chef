## The Client

Next Edge Talent is an influencer marketing platform that helps brands find the right influencers for their campaigns. The platform provides tools to create, manage, and track influencer marketing campaigns that drive results.

## The Work

I worked with the Next Edge Talent team to design and develop a responsive web application that allows brands to search for influencers, create campaigns, and track campaign performance. The platform features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for brands to find influencers that align with their target audience and create campaigns that drive results.

The eventual goal of the platform is to include a dashboard that provides insights into campaign performance, influencer engagement, and audience demographics. This data helps brands optimize their campaigns and make data-driven decisions to maximize ROI.

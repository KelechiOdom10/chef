## The Client

AA Property UK is a leading real estate company serving Central and North-west London. The company specializes in property management, sales, and lettings. AA Property UK offers a wide range of services to help clients buy, sell, rent, and manage properties in the London area.

## The Work

I worked with the AA Property UK team to design and develop a responsive web application that showcases the company's services, properties, and team. The web application features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for visitors to learn more about the company, view property details, and contact the team.

The web application includes a property search feature that allows users to search for properties by location, price range, and property type. Users can view property details, photos, and contact information for each property.

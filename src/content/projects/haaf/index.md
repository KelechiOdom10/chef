HAAF is a non-profit organization that is on a mission to close the gap of understanding, championing the empowerment and inclusion of individuals within the autism spectrum. The organization provides resources, support, and advocacy for individuals with autism and their families in Nigeria.

## The Work

I worked with the HAAF team to design and develop a responsive web application that provides resources, support, and advocacy for individuals with autism and their families. The platform features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for individuals to access resources, connect with support groups, and find advocacy services.

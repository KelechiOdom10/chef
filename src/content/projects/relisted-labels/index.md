## The Client

Relisted Labels is a fashion rental platform that allows users to rent and relist fashion labels and accessories for any occasion. The platform provides tools to browse, rent, and relist fashion items that are perfect for special events, photoshoots, or everyday wear in Nigeria.

## The Work

I worked with the Relisted Labels team to design and develop a responsive web application that allows users to browse, rent, and relist fashion items. The platform features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to search for items, view item details, and complete transactions.

The platform also includes a social feature to view each other's listings, and communicate/message with each other. This feature promotes community engagement and encourages users to share their fashion items with others.
